That about sums it up for now.

Loot Goblin Progress Report

I have implemented the following for Loot Goblin: A basic dungeon manager that randomly generates rooms from a list of room prefabs, rotating new rooms to ensure the entrance matches the cardinal of the room exited; a character sprite with 8 degree motion and 360 degree attack freedom, along with a dodge roll and room exiting; basic monster functionality, with a simple state machine AI and sword attack based when the monster nears the player; a simple loot system with each killed monster providing some amount of gold; a simple win condition when the player reaches 10 gold and exits a room; a lose condition when the player gets hit twice by a Goblin; a basic inventory system keeping track of what the player is carrying (in the prototype, this is automatically just a sword); a main menu with a controls explanation, a start button and a quit button.
I have still yet to implement the following: Boss fight as a dungeon floor completion; more monsters and better AI (the combat is quite unbalanced at the moment); loot in terms of more than just gold; health bar, inventory UI; shop/town phase; magical companion with room hints.
I think I am on schedule. I have most of my basic mechanics in place, I just need to tweak them to feel better and add the rest of my desired features, which should definitely keep me busy up to the due date.

Loot Goblinâ€™s current gameplay loop: Enter a room, fight monsters, leave room, repeat until you have enough gold to win, or you die.
